we the team tech elites has chosen the second sustainable development goal i.e ZERO HUNGER as project and our project title is HUNGER WARRIORS..
our project consists of two main users one the volunteer and the second the people who uses our website.And the users have acces to login,register fields with some respective credentials.
These details are passed to the volunteer and the volunteer approches the user and collects food from them which excess for the user.If the food is good and can be eaten by humans then the volunteer delivers the food
to the beggers,otherwise he serves the food to the pets or animals which relay on the road side.Based on the quantity of food the volunteer decides whom he has to give the food.Like wise the system happens and the users
who donates will get some rewards for their contribution to demolish the hunger.THANK YOU..!
